 <p class="title">CelNav</p>
 <p class="subtitle">Electronic Almanac and Sight Reduction</p>

 <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

 <p> CelNav is a simple utility to support celestial navigation on a small boat. It provides the data listed on the daily pages of the Nautical Almanac as well as functionality for sight reduction and calculation of a fix from two LOPs taken in relatively short succession (the program will correct for motion of observer between the sights for the LOPs). In addition, it provides some support for identifying suitable stars and planets for a sight or fix.</p>

 <p> CelNav has been developed to enable quick and efficient sight reduction and fix calculation especially on a smaller boat. It doesn't have any mouth watering eye candy but allows data entry with a minimum number of key strokes and minimal or no use of a mouse/touchpad. The boat is rolling, your fingers are cold and damp, and the last thing you want to do is to stare at a small screen below decks longer than absolutely necessary or fiddle with tiny controls on sophisticated interface widgets...</p>

 <p> CelNav uses the PyEphem package to calculate ephemeris data for Sun, Moon, navigational planets and navigational stars (<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/index.html">http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/index.html</a>). CelNav can also be configured to employ Steve Moshier's "AA Computer Ephemeris" program for reducing sights of navigational stars. See <a href="02_configuration.html">[2] Configuration</a> for further details.</p>
